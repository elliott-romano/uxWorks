                <p>Senior Product Designer: Product Growth & Onboarding</p>
                <p class="project-description">In 2020, DigitalOcean formed a new product working group that operated between the brand and product organizations, focused on improving the experience for new and evaluative developers. As the first dedicated designer, I led the strategy, research, and rollout of a new onboarding experience, ensuring a smoother path from first contact to product activation.</p>

                        Leading up to 2020, DigitalOcean experienced substantial growth, expanding its offerings beyond cloud servers to a broader suite of products designed for modern cloud development. However, its onboarding experience struggled to keep pace with this shift.

                            The original user experience reflected DigitalOcean's legacy design: after entering payment details and verifying their email, users faced a lengthy evaluation form before creating a cloud server. This approach became misaligned as the platform's offerings expanded beyond virtual machines to diverse, workflow-specific products.

                            <p>To understand this drop-off, I interviewed over 10 developers who stopped using DigitalOcean within their first month, all with less than a year of development experience, as well as university computer science students. Participants were surveyed on cloud knowledge and asked to navigate the platform from sign-up to evaluate its effectiveness.</p>

                        <p>Research findings indicated that users are primarily <strong>focused on learning programming rather than server or IT management</strong>. They often lack experience with deployment and Linux, <strong>relying heavily on documentation and trusted guidance</strong>  .
